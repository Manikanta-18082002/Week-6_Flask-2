    "\n",
    "Data Retrieval: The request object allows you to retrieve data sent by clients, such as form data, query parameters, JSON data, and file uploads. You can access this data using attributes like request.form, request.args, request.json, and request.files.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Methods: You can determine the HTTP method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) by accessing request.method. This information is vital for routing and handling different types of requests.\n",

    "Preventing Duplicate Form Submissions: After a user submits a form (e.g., a registration form), you can use redirect() to prevent them from accidentally resubmitting the form if they refresh the page. This is known as the \"Post/Redirect/Get\" (PRG) pattern.\n",

In Flask, the render_template() function is used to render these templates and generate dynamic HTML or other text-based responses.\n",

It takes the name of the template file as an argument (usually with an .html or .txt extension) and any variables you want to pass to the template. Flask then processes the template, replacing placeholders with actual values, and returns the resulting HTML or text as a response to the client."
